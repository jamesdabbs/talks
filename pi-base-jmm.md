# Goals

* Simplify literature search
* Pool knowledge and examples
* Allow exploration
* Remove tedium

---

^ Things to demo
^
^ Searching
^ - metrizable
^ - countably metacompact + ~countably paracompact
^ - theorem converse
^ - 'completely regular, ~ccc, ~perfectly normal'
^
^ Deduction
^ - Theorems related to cozero complemented and ?- search
^ - Add CCC to Sorgenfrey's ...
^ - Semantic awareness: counterexample checking when adding theorems

# Future Work - Features

* Integrate with existing proof assistants (e.g. Coq, Isabelle, Mizar)
* Support cardinal-valued properties
* Allow for different axioms (MA, ◊)
* Framework for atlas of other topics

---

# Future Work - Content

* Fill in missing proofs
* Expand list of properties (e.g. Collection-wise Normal, Proximal)
* Add more examples
